            <h1 id="reflection-title">My Growing Pain</h1>
                <p id="reflection">1. One thing I struggled with most during coding was learning to apply tags in the correct format. Learning to code is not only just memorizing the name of the tags, but also writing them down in the correct order, sequence, etc. A single incorrect sequence or order could result in completely different outcomes, and usually just disables the code. For example, both header and footer sections/divisions are supposed to be included in the body tag, and not doing so causes point deduction when graded on code correctness. Despite the fact that some newer browsers can still read divisions out of the body tag, it is not correct in terms of html coding.</p>
                <p id="reflection">2. When my code doesn't work, I usually use the inspect element function of web browsers to double check the coding. This function allows me to target a specific section of the website and refer to its code, minimizing the area the error most likely occurred. There are also some other columns of each line of coding that shows style attributes and the code of each division. For example, I would accidentally type an s before the unit px of fonts, which results in no changes in font style. By checking the code of the webpage with inspect elements, I can clearly see that the font-size: 20spx is disabled, which shows me the mistake I made, allowing more efficient error corrections.</p>
                <p id="reflection">3. Wireframing felt easier than coding because the first can be done with nearly zero knowledge of the topic, simply using certain tools/websites/applications can result in quite satisfactory results, and there are basically no possible mistakes. On the other hand, coding requires basic knowledge of tags and their formats, and there are mistakes that could be made during the process of coding. Another crucial point that separates the difficulty of wireframing and coding is whether our acts directly result in changes of the product. Specifically, moving a block in wireframing is straightforward, simply drag the block around. But moving the same block in coding needs adjustments to its container, using margin to change the relative distance between the container and the borders, and fitting the block into the container. This is only just a basic way, there are countless other methods to achieve the same goal in coding. While coding may be more fun, it is much more complex and complicated.</p>
                <p id="reflection">4. One thing I learned about myself while learning to code is that I actually enjoy working on things with some difficulty, and that I can focus quite well on tasks that are not my favorite. I particularly feel overwhelmed by the repetitive chunks of code when coding, as too many similar sections can seem complicated. Even so, I could focus on coding without being constantly distracted by more interesting activities.</p>

                <p id="reflection">You're right, coding sometimes seem too repetitive. However, describe your feeling when something you spent time making finally yields the result you want.</p>
            <h2 id="reflection-title">My Response to Teacher's Response</h2>
                <p id="reflection">It is quite satisfactory to see the final product after spending time and effort on coding. The sense of accomplishment definitely makes up for the long hours(not true) of coding.</p>
